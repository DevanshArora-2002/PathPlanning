Consider a configuration space given below. The start and goal positions are (1,1) and (20,20) respectively. The
obstacles are considered as the circular objects represented by center position and radius (r) as given below:
(1) Obstacle 1 → Center- (4.5,3), r = 2
(2) Obstacle 2 → Center- (3,12), r = 2
(3) Obstacle 3 → Center- (15,15), r = 3
